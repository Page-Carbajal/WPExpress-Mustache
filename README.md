# WPExpress Mustache

Since **WPExpress** version 1.4.0. **WPExpress/UI** was deprecated. 
 
All necessary files for **WPExpress/UI** were assimilated into the core and the support for **WPExpress/UI** project was therefore terminated.
   
The last version of [WPExpress/UI](https://packagist.org/packages/page-carbajal/wpexpress-ui) is available on packagist and also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Page-Carbajal/WPExpress-UI).

I went into great details about my pain on [terminating the WPExpress/UI](http://pagecarbajal.com/a-minimal-footprint/) this project on my blog. My greatest concern was to give up on templating engines. 

However I decided to be a grown up and not to force my vision into the world. I keep my commitment to provide useful tool for development. But I also need to get some satisfaction on coding for me.

This project allows me and others to use Mustache as RenderEngine.
